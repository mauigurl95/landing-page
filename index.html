                        <li>Pale blue <span>Earth</span> should be filled with strife. It must be hard being home to all this life. But the 3rd little planet doesn't feel tense. It is quite proud to be the most dense!</li>
                        <li>Super fast <span>Mercury</span> could sing a sad tune. It must get lonely without any moons. But the 1st little planet never feels bad. Being closest to the Sun is a reason to be glad!</li>
                        <li>Big stormy <span>Jupiter</span> looks weighed down with mass. 4 octillion pounds is a lot of gas. But the 5th little planet doesn't feel down. Not with so many friendly moons around!</li>
                        <li>Dry red <span>Mars</span><br> looks a bit rusty. All those storms can make a planet dusty. But the 4th little planet never sheds a tear. It has the tallest mountain of any planet here!</li>
