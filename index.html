                        <li>Super fast <span>Mercury</span> could sing a sad tune. It must get lonely without any moons. But the 1st little planet never feels bad. Being closest to the Sun is a reason to be glad!</li>
                        <li>Big stormy <span>Jupiter</span> looks weighed down with mass. 4 octillion pounds is a lot of gas. But the 5th little planet doesn't feel down. Not with so many friendly moons around!</li>
                        <li>Dry red <span>Mars</span><br> looks a bit rusty. All those storms can make a planet dusty. But the 4th little planet never sheds a tear. It has the tallest mountain of any planet here!</li>
